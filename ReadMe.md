### This is supposed to be simple instructions for your first time JWST MIRI photometry extraction

I prepared it with my experience. I don't use jupyter notebook, so I split procedure into the steps. I hope each step is well commented. Just follow the steps. If you have any questions you can contact me directly, I will be happy to help and change the instructions (krzysztof.lisiecki@ncbj.gov.pl). 

We are going to find fluxes of galaxies (this is called photometry). We will use Hubble Space Telescope's images to detect galaxies and then using their astrometry we will find their fluxes in MIRI images. This is so-called double image mode and it allows us to directly connect new detections to previous ones.
